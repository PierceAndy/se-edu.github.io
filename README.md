# SE-EDU : Resources for Software Engineering Education
This GitHub organization is a collection of **FOSS** resources for Software Engineering educators and students. 
In particular, it aims to provide sample code bases that are bigger in size and non-trivial in complexity.

## Sub Projects
These are some of the sub projects (come with code, learning outcomes, exercises, etc.) 

### Project: AddressBook 
A series of Java projects with increasing size and complexity, to be used as examples (or starter projects) in SE courses.
  * [**Level 1**](../../../addressbook-level1) [1 KLoC] : Non-OOP, No GUI (Command Line Interface)
  * [**Level 2**](../../../addressbook-level2) [2 KLoC] : OOP, No GUI (Command Line Interface)
  * [**Level 3**](../../../addressbook-level3) [3 KLoC] : Simple GUI with text input and output<br><br>

  * **Levels 5, 6, ...** (Coming soon)
